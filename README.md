# Titanic-Machine-Learning-from-Disaster
## Introduction
Few weeks ago I decided to apply what I learn from my machine learning class into practical uses. Kaggle is a great place for me to start and get to know the workflow of data analytics. I did not get a really good score on this introductory level problem but I am certain that I gained quite alot experiences and knowledges on how to use all these packages and find patterns in the data, which in a sense is equally important as how and why ML algorithm works. This notebook serves as a reflection on how I tackled the problem and hopefully someone out there struggling may find a little help.
